# CustomNeuralNetwork
This is a neural network built in python from the ground up using only NumPy and math libraries. The purpose is to get a deeper understand of how basic machine learning occurs with some visual aid to see the progress. While the network works correctly I would not recommend using it for practical applications as at the moment it is still very bare-bones and it has virtually no speed/GPU optimizations. That being said the code below uses the mnist dataset to learn to classify the handwritten digits and it works quite well. Most of the techniques used can be found in this e-book (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) but none of the code from the book is used with the exception of loading the data set into the program
